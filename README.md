CSE 676 Deep Learning project
Please download the whole files as the computation is really slow for training.

### Step1:
Create Folders names image_data and image_encoded_data

### Step2:
Open the classifier.ipynb file to see the training and other results of the classifier.

### Step3:
To train the encoder you need to run Dataset_colab_new.ipynb file.
A fully trained model result is saved in Classifier_state_dict.

### Step4:
To Encode your smiles (Molecular formula images) into tensor please run Encode_Image_and_save.ipynb

### Step5:
Run the classifier.ipynb which imports the encoded data and run the classifiers
All the graphs and results are in the file classifier.ipynb
